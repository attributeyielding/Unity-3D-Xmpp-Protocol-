# Unity 3D Xmpp Library Targeting c# DOTNET 2.0
First Attemps to Implement Xmpp Library For Unity 3D &lt; Net 3.5 With C#


Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is a communication protocol for message-oriented middleware based on XML (Extensible Markup Language).[1] It enables the near-real-time exchange of structured yet extensible data between any two or more network entities.[2] Originally named Jabber,[3] the protocol was developed by the homonym open-source community in 1999 for near real-time instant messaging (IM), presence information, and contact list maintenance. Designed to be extensible, the protocol has been used also for publish-subscribe systems, signalling for VoIP, video, file transfer, gaming, the Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as the smart grid, and social networking services.

Unlike most instant messaging protocols, XMPP is defined in an open standard and uses an open systems approach of development and application, by which anyone may implement an XMPP service and interoperate with other organizations' implementations. Because XMPP is an open protocol, implementations can be developed using any software license and many server, client, and library implementations are distributed as free and open-source software. Numerous freeware and commercial software implementations also exist.





<b>
  YOU NEED A WORKING XMPP SERVER To TEST THIS LIBRARY
  
  
  
  

1- Built Dll File From Visual Studio solution



2- Import the dll into Unity3D under folder plugins



3- Works on PC/Linux/Mac/Android Platform/Ios Platform
